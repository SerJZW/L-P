[Verse]
           C
When the days are cold
           G
And the cards all fold
           Am
And the saints we see
          F
Are all made of gold
           C
When your dreams all fail
           G
And the ones we hail
           Am
Are the worst of all
          F
And the blood's run stale

C                    G
  I want to hide the truth
                  Am
I want to shelter you
                   F
But with the beast inside
                       C
There's nowhere we can hide
                  G
No matter what we breed
                     Am
We still are made of greed
                   F
This is my kingdom come
                   C
This is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
C                  G
  When you feel my heat
             Am
Look into my eyes
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
              G
Don't get too close
            Am
It's dark inside
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide

[Verse]
           C
When the curtain's call
           G
Is the last of all
           Am
When the lights fade out
          F
All the sinners crawl
          C
So they dug your grave
           G
And the masquerade
           Am
Will come calling out
          F
At the mess you made

C                       G
  Don't want to let you down
              Am
But I Am hell bound
                       F
Though this is all for you
                       C
Don't want to hide the truth

                  G
No matter what we breed
                     Am
We still are made of greed
                   F
This is my kingdom come
                   C
This is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
C                  G
  When you feel my heat
             Am
Look into my eyes
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
              G
Don't get too close
            Am
It's dark inside
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
C                        G
  They say it's what you make
                 Am
I say it's up to fate
                 F
It's woven in my soul
                  C
I need to let you go
                        G
Your eyes they shine so bright
                    Am
I want to save that light
                    F
I can't escape this now
                   C
Unless you show me how

[Chorus]
C                  G
  When you feel my heat
             Am
Look into my eyes
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
              G
Don't get too close
            Am
It's dark inside
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
